Intelliquinte is a single-member LLC because, at this stage, having employees would add unnecessary complexity. Right now, I’d have to deal with things like safety posters, payroll (even though we’re not yet profitable), and a host of other logistical tasks.</font><p><font face="Courier New, monospace"><br></font><p><font face="Courier New, monospace">I started Intelliquinte because I wanted to create something meaningful. I take great pride in it because Intelliquinte reflects who I am, what I love, and what I envision for the future.
                    </font></p><p><font face="Courier New, monospace">As Intelliquinte grows, I hope it embodies values like honesty, respect, and dignity. These are simple principles, but I believe they’re powerful. I don’t want to mislead the people who helped me build this company, though that doesn’t mean I have to share every detail. That’s where dignity comes in. Intelliquinte will admit when we’re wrong and take steps to make things right. As CEO, I can’t carry guilt around—it’s too heavy. I want us to foster respect, creating an unspoken agreement between Intelliquinte and our customers. We provide services, and in return, we ask that you respect our intellectual property, our team, and the effort we put in. We welcome constructive criticism, opinions, and those who have something to say. We will make an effort to ensure you feel acknowledged.
                    </font></p><p><font face="Courier New, monospace"><br></font></p><p><font face="Courier New, monospace">We believe most people deserve a platform, but no one is entitled to be listened to. It’s important to bring value to what you say. Sometimes, you’ll find people who appreciate your voice and decide to stick around through the awkward moments and bad jokes. Those are the people you want in your life—the ones you’ll support even if their shows aren’t perfect. Be there to laugh, to encourage, and to share lighthearted moments with them.
                    </font></p><p><font face="Courier New, monospace">During this journey as a business owner, worker, student, and citizen, I’m finding my inner circle—the people who’ll laugh with me, even when my jokes fall flat. Maybe you’re at that point in life too. We all go through seasons of loneliness, and sometimes, those seasons last longer than we’d like.
                    </font></p><p><font face="Courier New, monospace"><br></font></p><p><font face="Courier New, monospace">Right now, Intelliquinte is a “one-man army,” hoping to make something meaningful for the people who welcome us with open arms. We all have a voice, and while I know I’m not entitled to be heard, I hope people find value in my products and my vision. I know I can’t do it all, but I’m having the time of my life creating these projects, connecting with people, and bringing ideas to life.
                    </font></p><p><font face="Courier New, monospace"><br></font></p><p><font face="Courier New, monospace">Thank you for joining me in this journey. Welcome to the first newsletter from Intelliquinte. As we grow, I hope that money and success don’t change me too much. And if they do, I hope I stay humble.
